    Gasoline Engine
    
    Requires external ignitions source i.e. spark plug. 
    Uses a homogenous air/fuel mixture. Homogeneity achieved through external mixture formation i.e. manifold injection or internal mixture formation i.e. gasoline direct injection.

    Combustion in Gasoline Engines
    
    Ignition
    Purpose to initiate combustion process. Depending on velocity of the subsequent combustion and piston speed the point of igntion must be variably adapted. 
    
    Combustion of Homogenous Mixtures
    Combustion of Partially Homogenous Mixtures
    Pollutant formation and reduction of pollutants in gas engines
    By products C02 and H20 NOx, HC and CO, Soot, and S0 compounds
    
    Diesel Engine
    Does not require external ignition, has higher engine stability.
    Fuel spray formation, fuel vaporization, fuel mixing and combustion can happen within a short time.
